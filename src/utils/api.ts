          <p>Sri Lanka has several key renewable energy resources:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydropower:</strong> The most established renewable resource, contributing about 40% of electricity generation with major facilities at Victoria, Kotmale, and Samanalawewa.</li>
            <li><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> High solar irradiation levels (1,700-1,900 kWh/mÂ²/year) make it suitable for photovoltaic systems and solar thermal applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Wind Energy:</strong> Significant potential in northwestern and southeastern coastal areas, with wind speeds of 7-8 m/s. The Mannar Wind Power Project is a notable development.</li>
            <li><strong>Biomass:</strong> Abundant agricultural residues and dedicated energy plantations provide sustainable biomass resources for power generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Mini/Micro Hydro:</strong> Small-scale hydropower projects in rural areas contribute to distributed generation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The government aims to achieve 70% renewable energy in the electricity mix by 2030 as part of its sustainable energy transition strategy.</p>
