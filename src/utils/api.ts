        <h3>Main Renewable Energy Resources in Sri Lanka</h3>
        <p>Sri Lanka has several key renewable energy resources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hydropower:</strong> The most established renewable resource, contributing about 40% of electricity generation with major facilities at Victoria, Kotmale, and Samanalawewa.</li>
          <li><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> High solar irradiation levels (1,700-1,900 kWh/mÂ²/year) make it suitable for photovoltaic systems and solar thermal applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Wind Energy:</strong> Significant potential in northwestern and southeastern coastal areas, with wind speeds of 7-8 m/s. The Mannar Wind Power Project is a notable development.</li>
          <li><strong>Biomass:</strong> Abundant agricultural residues and dedicated energy plantations provide sustainable biomass resources for power generation.</li>
          <li><strong>Mini/Micro Hydro:</strong> Small-scale hydropower projects in rural areas contribute to distributed generation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The government aims to achieve 70% renewable energy in the electricity mix by 2030 as part of its sustainable energy transition strategy.</p>

        <p>Key hydropower facilities include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mahaweli Complex:</strong> Victoria (210 MW), Kotmale (201 MW), Randenigala (122 MW), Rantambe (49 MW)</li>
