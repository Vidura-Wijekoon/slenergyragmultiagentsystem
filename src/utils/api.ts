            <li><strong>Hydropower:</strong> The most established renewable resource, contributing about 40% of electricity generation with major facilities at Victoria, Kotmale, and Samanalawewa.</li>
            <li><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> High solar irradiation levels (1,700-1,900 kWh/mÂ²/year) make it suitable for photovoltaic systems and solar thermal applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Wind Energy:</strong> Significant potential in northwestern and southeastern coastal areas, with wind speeds of 7-8 m/s. The Mannar Wind Power Project is a notable development.</li>
            <li><strong>Biomass:</strong> Abundant agricultural residues and dedicated energy plantations provide sustainable biomass resources for power generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Mini/Micro Hydro:</strong> Small-scale hydropower projects in rural areas contribute to distributed generation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The government aims to achieve 70% renewable energy in the electricity mix by 2030 as part of its sustainable energy transition strategy.</p>

          <p>The current electricity demand in Sri Lanka is constantly fluctuating throughout the day. Peak demand typically occurs between 6:30 PM and 10:30 PM when residential consumption is at its highest.</p>
          <p>The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) manages this demand through a combination of baseload power plants (primarily coal and major hydropower) and peaking power plants (including gas turbines and smaller hydropower stations).</p>
          <p>Real-time monitoring and forecasting systems help grid operators anticipate and respond to changes in demand, ensuring grid stability and reliability.</p>

          <h3>Real-Time Power Generation in Sri Lanka</h3>
          <p>Sri Lanka's electricity generation comes from a diverse mix of sources, with real-time proportions varying based on resource availability, demand patterns, and economic dispatching decisions.</p>
          <p>The generation mix includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Coal:</strong> Provides baseload power from the Norochcholai power plant</li>
            <li><strong>Major Hydropower:</strong> Varies seasonally based on reservoir levels</li>
            <li><strong>Oil & Diesel:</strong> Used primarily for peaking and backup</li>
            <li><strong>Wind & Solar:</strong> Fluctuate based on weather conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Mini-hydro:</strong> Provides distributed generation across the country</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The CEB's System Control Center continuously optimizes this mix to ensure reliable supply at minimum cost.</p>
